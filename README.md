# FriendChecker
A simple plugin for SCP:SL Smod2 servers, which helps to find friend circles on a server. You can list all friend circles on the server, or just the friend circle for one player.

## Installation
**[Smod2](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2) must be installed for this to work.**

1. Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/NeonWizard/SCP-FriendChecker/releases/latest) of FriendChecker.
2. Place FriendChecker.dll in your server's `sm_plugins` folder.

## Commands
Command | Value Type | Description
--- | :---: | ---

## Configuration
Config Option | Value Type | Default Value | Description
:---: | :---: | :---: | ---
friendchecker_enable | Bool | True | Whether FriendChecker should be enabled on server start.

*Note that all configs should go in your server config file, not config_remoteadmin.txt
